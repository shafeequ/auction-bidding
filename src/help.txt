Hallo Fabian,

I am also equally interested and admired by the Caseable core value as Innovation.
I love innovation and have won may awards in Yahoo! and McAfee for my Innovation in the Consumer Group and there are lots of ideas have been turned into products.

Few of the products I have developed in consumer group and proud to share with you as follows.

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2xMJ9wArE   currently working on this in Mcafee
